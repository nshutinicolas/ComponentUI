### 1. Usage of `Text.LineStyle`  
- The code uses `Text.LineStyle` for underline styling. This type is not publicly documented or available in most SwiftUI releases (up to Swift 5.9/Xcode 15). Unless you're targeting iOS 17/macOS 14+ and using a beta/preview API, this will cause a compilation error.

### 2. AttributedString and Underlining  
- You set `attributed[range].underlineStyle = underlineStyle`. If `underlineStyle` is not compatible with standard AttributedString APIs, this may fail to compile or work as expected.

### 3. Single Occurrence for Link Ranges  
- The code only links the first occurrence of each substring in the text. If the substring appears multiple times, only the first instance is made tappable. Consider updating the logic to handle all occurrences.

### 4. Preview Macro Usage  
- The code uses the `#Preview` macro, which is only supported in Xcode 15/iOS 17+. If you intend to support older platforms, this will not compile.

### 5. Missing Documentation Comments  
- The new `TextWithLink` component lacks documentation comments for the struct and its initializer. Adding doc comments will improve maintainability and usability for other developers.

### 6. Proper Imports for AttributedString  
- You use `import SwiftUI`, which is correct, but ensure any features from other frameworks (like AttributedString from Foundation) have proper imports.

### 7. Handling Malformed URLs  
- When converting link values to URL, malformed URLs are silently ignored. Consider logging or handling these cases to help catch broken links.

### 8. README Example Consistency  
- In the README example, you set `highlightColor: .pink, underlineStyle: .single`, but the implementation provides defaults. Ensure the README and your API usage match for clarity.

### 9. Styling for Non-Link Text  
- The component only allows styling for linked substrings, not for the rest of the text. Consider adding support for customizing the style of non-link text.
